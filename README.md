An efficient communications application for coaches and players thats tailored for Soccer/Football.

"SideLine" is an efficient communications application between coaches and players tailored for soccer/football.

This application will be aimed as local/ National football teams in Ireland.  The reasoning behind wanting to create this application was to tackle a common problem for sports teams. The main problem is the lack of efficiency in relation to sports teams using apps such as WhatsApp to communicate with each other. From conducting surveys to hear responses from coaches and players, we found this problem to be considered true.

With the information gathered from the survey apps such as WhatsApp can be difficult to use. Important information being sent out from the coach to the players may not reach all the players. The coach may ask their players multiple questions and receive multiple answers and it becomes hard to get track of vital information. A player might receive too many messages in a WhatsApp group chat and could potentially miss out on information that is of high relevance to them.

Team HRZN plan to tackle this issue by creating an application that maximizes the efficiency of communication between players and coaches in one application. The app will have 1 on 1 chat systems, 1 to many chat systems, social feed and training logs. These features will be tested thoroughly and hopefully this will increase the efficiency of communication between players and coaches.
